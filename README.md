Risk Management Methods
In addition to the indicator selection I wanted the system to also randomly select none or multiple risk management methods.

When a strategy is generated, the system would also randomly select a threshold value, e.g. 5% for stop loss.

Here the risk management methods:

Stop loss

Take profit

Trailing stop.
